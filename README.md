Hello!

After graduating with my M.S. in Spatial Sciences from the University of Southern California, I started my career in GIS Analysis and Cartography. 👩🏻‍🎓

With a background in GIS, map design, psycholinguistics, and dance, I strive to combine my interdisciplinary knowledge to create beautiful, simple, informative, and accessible maps. 🗺

I am based in Seattle and am especially passionate about natural resources, environmental phenomena, and outdoor recreation. 🌲

Thanks for stopping by,

Madeline Rouse
